# Interfaces: between users and tasks

- Focus on the interaction between the user and the ***task*** through the interface, not the interaction between the user and the interface itself!
- Understand the tasks is important

## Tips for identifying tasks

1. Watch real users
2. Talk to them
3. Start small (start with smallest operators that users perform)
4. Abstract up (starting with small observations, abstract up to an understanding of the task. Keep asking why.)
5. You are not your user

# Usefulness and usability

- Goals of HCI: usefulness and usability
- Usefulness: The interface allows the user to accomplish their tasks
- Usability: how easy is it to use? (Could it offload some of the user's cognitive load?)

# Views of the user

- User roles:
    - processor
    - predictor
    - participant

## Processor

- Interface must:
    - fit within human limits (e.g. sense, memory, what users can do physically)
    - Usability: the interface is physically usable
- evaluated by quantitative experiments ('How dos the user do the task?'):
    - e.g. time to complete a task, reaction time to stimulus, etc.

## Predictor

- it's about human's knowledge, experience, expectations, and thought processes
- we want users to be able to predict what will happen in the world as a result of their actions
- we need to understand the user's thoughts and feeling
- Interface must:
    - fit with knowledge (leveraging existing knowledge, helping users learn new knowledge)
- Evaluated by qualitative studies ('What does the user want/what are they thinking?'):
    - usually done in lab settings (ex situ)
    - e.g. task analysis, cognitive walkthrough, etc.

## Participant

- Not just interested in an user's thoughts, but also what's going on around them
    - e.g. what's competing for their attention, what are their available cognitive resources, etc. (e.g. think about using navigation apps while driving)
- Interface must:
    - fit with the context
- Evaluated by in situ studies:
    - evaluating the interface in real-world settings (complete context)
    - e.g. field studies, diary studies, etc.   

## Views of the user and psychological schools of thought

- Processor: Behaviorism (focus on observable behaviors)
- Predictor: Cognitivism (focus on internal mental processes)
- Participant: Functionalism, system psychology (focus on mental behaviors in the context of the broader environments; e.g. distributed cognition, situated action models, etc.)

## Designing with the three views

Users as processors:
- Quantitative measures e.g. time to complete a task
- Pros: 
    - may use existing data
    - enables objective comparisons
- Cons:
    - unable to explain differences
    - can't differentiate by expertise (usually with work with expert users here)
    - helps optimize, not redesign

Users as predictors:
- Qualitative measures e.g. interviews, surveys, etc.
- Pros:
    - more complete picture of interaction
    - targets different levels of expertise
- Cons:
    - analysis may be expensive
    - analysis is subject to biases
    - ignores broader interaction context (e.g. think about the context of driving)

Users as participants:
- Pros:
    - evaluates interaction in context
    - captures authentic user attention
- Cons:
    - expensive to perform and analyze
    - requires real, functional interfaces
    - subject to interference (difficult to control)

# User experience - sans design

- User experience: emerges out of the interactions between humans and tasks via interfaces
- Whether we design for it or not, it will happen
- Beyond simple interaction, touches on emotional, personal, more experiential aspects of the relationship
- Experience at different levels:
    - individual
    - group
    - society (unintended: e.g. roles of Twitter in Arab Spring; intentional: e.g. new relationship statuses such as civil unions on Facebook)
