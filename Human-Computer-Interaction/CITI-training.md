# History and Ethical Principles - SBE

In 1979, the Commission issued the Belmont Report, the foundational document of the current system of U.S. human subjects protections. The Belmont Report outlines three key ethical principles for conducting research with human subjects:

Respect for persons
Beneficence
Justice

The Belmont Report informed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46), which was created in 1974 and later revised. In 1991, Subpart A of these regulations "Basic HHS Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects" was adopted by 15 federal agencies and became known as the Common Rule.

In 2017, HHS and 15 other federal agencies issued a revision to 45 CFR 46, Subpart A to strengthen human subject protections, as well as improve efficiency in research administration and operations. 20 agencies (including HHS) intend to follow the revised Common Rule (OHRP 2018).

# Respect for Persons
first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, 
and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. 

Autonomy means that people must be empowered to make decisions concerning their own actions and well-being.

individuals must be given the choice whether to participate in research, and they must be provided sufficient information and possess the mental competence to make that choice.

Individuals with "diminished decision-making capacity" may lack the ability to comprehend study procedures or how participating in a study might adversely affect them. Special care should be taken to protect those with diminished capacity to the point of excluding individuals who are not able to give meaningful consent to participate in research.

Children are a class of research subjects with limited autonomy. 

## Voluntariness

## Informed Consent

“The informed consent process involves three key features: (1) disclosing to potential research subjects information needed to make an informed decision; (2) facilitating the understanding of what has been disclosed; and (3) promoting the voluntariness of the decision about whether or not to participate in the research.”

Informed consent also must be comprehensible to prospective subjects. Comprehension is the ability to understand what one is being asked to do, as well as the implications of any risks of harm associated with participating in the research. Comprehension may depend on an individual's mental capacity, but it also relates to the comprehensibility of the informed consent document, or, in the case of oral consent, the script. Researchers should create consent processes that are at an appropriate language level for the subject population. Study information can be presented in a conversational style that is easily understood by a wide range of individuals. In general, an eighth-grade reading level or lower is advised.

# Beneficence

"Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of beneficence. The term 'beneficence' is often understood to cover acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict obligation. In this document, beneficence is understood in a stronger sense, as an obligation. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expression of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms (The National Commission 1979)."

## Minimizing Risks of Harm and Maximizing Possible Benefits





# Justice

" An injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly (The National Commission 1979)."

## Distributing Benefits and Burdens of Research

"Justice and equitable treatment refer to issues of procedural and distributive justice that may arise at any stage of the research process. An idea that creates prejudices against some sector of society is unfair. An experimental treatment is also unfair if resources known to be vital to subjects' well-being are withheld from subjects in one group and given to those in another."

# Balancing the Three Principles

It was the National Commission's intention that each of the three principles should have equal moral force. This means that in some situations, the three principles might be in conflict with one another. For example, we might derive from the principle of respect for persons that we should limit the involvement of children in research because children are unable to choose for themselves. However, we might derive from the principle of justice that we must involve children in studies so that children will have the opportunity to benefit from the research. The Belmont Report states that one principle does not always outweigh another. Rather, we are required to consider each case separately and on its own merits while seeking to uphold all three principles.

The issue of deception in research illustrates this tension between principles. When an Institutional Review Board (IRB) feels the use of deception is justified because the research question could not be answered if subjects were fully informed but there are potential benefits, the principle of beneficence holds greater weight than that of respect for persons. For example, deceptive experimental manipulations may be used to make subjects feel rejected in order to study the effects of social rejection.


# The Belmont Report and the Common Rule
The Common Rule (Protection of Human Subjects 2018) lists criteria for IRB approval of a research plan that are directly related to the three Belmont principles.

## Respect for Persons

Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.116.
Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.117.
When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.

## Beneficence
Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.
When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

## Justice
Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

# Defining Research with Human Subjects - SBE

A study that meets the federal regulation’s definition of research, but does not involve human subjects, does not need IRB review. Similarly, a study may involve human subjects, but not meet the definition of research and would, therefore, not require an IRB review.

Research is defined by federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.102 (Protection of Human Subjects 2018), as "a systematic investigation including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge."

This definition was revised in the 2018 Requirements version of the Common Rule to specifically exclude the following activities:

Scholarly and journalistic activities (for example, oral history, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and historical scholarship)
Public health surveillance activities
Collection and analysis of information, biospecimens, or records by or for a criminal justice agency for activities authorized by law or court order or criminal investigative purposes
Authorized intelligence, homeland security, defense, or national security mission operational activities

## Systematic Investigation

The definition of research starts by stating that the activity must be a systematic investigation. 

## Including Research Development, Testing, and Evaluation

Pilot studies and other preliminary studies fall under the definition of research. Both of the following preliminary components of a study constitute research with human subjects:

Convening a focus group to help researchers develop a questionnaire
Pilot testing a questionnaire

## Designed to Develop or Contribute to Generalizable Knowledge

Some activities that involve interactions with humans and data gathering may not meet the definition of research because they are designed to accomplish something else, such as program improvement (also called quality improvement activities).

# Defining Human Subject

In order to meet the definition of research with human subjects a researcher must obtain data about a living individual through interaction or intervention or, alternatively, obtain individually identifiable private information.

## A Living Individual

## About Whom 

Another key part of the human subjects definition is the “about whom” wording.

Some research that involves interactions with living individuals does not meet the regulatory definition of research with human subjects because the focus of the investigation is not on the opinions, characteristics, or behavior of the individual. Instead, the individual is asked to provide information about something. 


# Private Information

private information includes:

"Information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and
Information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public” (for example, a school record).


# Observing and Recording Private Behavior

# Private Information Provided by Individuals for Specific Purposes

Owners of identifiable data impose restrictions on the use of the data they provide researchers. Institutions may release de-identified data publicly, but only release identifiable data to researchers with IRB-approved data protection plans.

# 45 CFR 46: Protection of Human Subjects

Subpart A of 45 CFR 46 is often referred to as the Common Rule.

Three subparts (B, C, and D) were added to the basic provisions of the federal regulations to further protect vulnerable subjects in research

Some federal agencies that adopted the Common Rule also have adopted some or all of the other subparts of the HHS regulations, but others have not. For example, while the ED has adopted the additional protections for children, the NSF has not.

# Assurances with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)

Every institution conducting research with federal support is required to enter into an agreement called an "assurance." Most assurances are filed with OHRP. An assurance identifies the regulations for protecting research subjects that the institution will abide by. In the U.S., this is the Common Rule.

The assurance only applies to studies that are funded by a Common Rule department or agency.

Some institutions apply the Common Rule to all research regardless of the funding source.

However, the non-federally supported research would not be subject to OHRP oversight or the assurance.

Some institutions also choose to apply the additional Subparts B, C, and D to all research regardless of the funding source. 

# Content of the Federal Regulations

## What Research Must Be Reviewed

The first step in deciding whether a project needs to be reviewed is to determine whether it meets the definition of research with human subjects.

it has been determined that a project meets the definition of research and includes human subjects, the next step is to determine the type of review it needs.

### Research Eligible for Exemption

Research may be eligible for exemption from the regulations if all the activities associated with the research fall into one or more of eight categories. Of the eight categories, social, behavioral, and educational research typically falls into one of these:

- Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving normal educational practices.
- Research only involving educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior, provided that at least one of these criteria is met:
    - The investigator records the information in such a way that subjects cannot be readily identified
    - Any disclosure of identifiable information outside the research setting would not place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, or reputation.
    - The investigator records the information and the subjects can be readily identified, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review.
    - Note: If Subpart D applies, either by sponsor requirement or institutional choice, interviews, surveys, and participant observation with children as research subjects might not be exempt under Exempt Category 2 (there are specific restrictions for Exempt Category 2 research complying with Subpart D).
- Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection.
- Secondary research for which consent is not required.

### Expedited Review or Convened IRB Review

If research is not eligible for exemption, the remaining options are expedited review or convened IRB review for initial approval. 

Expedited review is conducted by one or more experienced IRB members. Convened IRB review is conducted by a quorum of the IRB.

To be eligible for expedited review for initial approval, research must meet criteria, including the following:

- Pose no more than minimal risk to subjects
“Minimal risk” means “the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests” (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).

- Consist of only one or more research activities specified in the federal regulations as eligible for expedited review (It may be helpful to review the Categories of Research That May Be Reviewed by the Institutional Review Board [IRB] through an Expedited Review Procedure).

If the primary risk to subjects is a breach of confidentiality and the risk can be managed to no more than minimal , then the research may be reviewed through an expedited process.

In addition to studies involving surveys, focus groups, interviews, and observations of behavior, studies involving the collection of biological samples and data by non-invasive means may be eligible for expedited review. Biological samples include saliva and fingernail cuttings or measures of pesticide exposure using skin patches. Data collected by non-invasive means includes galvanic skin response, heart rate, and blood pressure.

Research involving identifiable data collected for non-research purposes may be eligible for expedited review as may the collection of existing data from voice, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.

Institutional policy, local conditions, and subject vulnerability may require review by the convened IRB even for a study with no more than minimal risk, such as a study of individuals with impaired decision-making.

## Who must review research with human subjects?

Although federal regulations use the term IRB, institutions may choose a different name for the committee, such as Research Ethics Board or Independent Ethics Committee.

### Membership
The minimum size and required composition of an IRB is described in detail in the federal regulations. An IRB must have at least five members (including a person not otherwise affiliated with the institution, a scientist, and a non-scientist). The non-affiliated member can also be the non-scientist or scientist (the individual may be the same person fulfilling two requirements). Its membership must be diverse, including race, gender, and cultural background.

### Authority of the IRB
Federal regulations stipulate that an IRB can:

Approve research
Disapprove research
Require modifications to secure approval
Conduct continuing reviews
Suspend or terminate approval
Observe, or have a third party observe, the consent process and the research procedures

## What questions should be addressed during a review?

### Exempt Research

For most exempt determinations, an experienced staff member may make the determination for exemption. However, for limited IRB review, the determination must be made by an IRB member. Further, in the case of limited IRB review as a condition for exemption, the IRB reviewer must review the research per limited IRB review criteria and make the determinations required for limited IRB review.

### Expedited and IRB Review

The same questions must be asked when an IRB member is conducting an expedited review and when the convened IRB is conducting the review.

Have the risks to subjects been minimized using procedures that are consistent with sound research design?
Are the risks reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits?
Is the selection of subjects equitable?
Are adequate procedures in place to ensure privacy and confidentiality?
Is there a plan to monitor the data and safety of the subjects, if necessary?
Will informed consent be sought and appropriately documented? Do proposed alterations or waivers of informed consent meet the criteria for approval?
Are safeguards in place to protect vulnerable populations?


### Comparison of Expedited and Convened IRB Review

Review procedures for expedited review and convened IRB review are similar in several ways:

The review criteria are the same.
Reviewers using the expedited review procedure or the convened IRB can request modifications to research plans and approve the plans.

A key difference between the two processes is that expedited reviewers cannot disapprove a research plan. If an expedited reviewer thinks a research plan is not approvable, the plan must be submitted to the IRB for review.

Another very important difference is that research initially approved in accordance with expedited review does not need continuing review. 

## Approved Research: Additional Reviews

Federal regulations permit expedited review procedures to be used for continuing review if the initial review was conducted by a convened IRB under some specific conditions

Continuing review is not required for exempt studies approved via limited IRB review.
