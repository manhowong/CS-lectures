# Zooming out

(Also see Lesson 2.1)
- Human as processor
    - e.g. **physical** interaction with an interface
- Human as predictor
    - e.g. interaction with the **task as a whole** 
- Human as participant
    - e.g. how the interaction with the interface **relates to other things in the world**
    - e.g. how the interface affects the **society**

# 5 Tips for on-screen UI design

1. Use a **grid**
    - guides users around the screen, e.g. highlighting important content, grouping related content
2. Use **whitespace**
    - helps users chunk information for easier processing
    - guides users visually
3. Know your **Gestalt principles**
    - i.e. how users perceive groups of objects
    - e.g. **proximity, continuation, movement, similarity**
4. **Reduce clutter**
    - e.g. use whitespace to group objects instead of drawing lines around them
5. Design in **grayscale**
    - color shouldn't be necessary for understanding the interface
    - **"color emphasizes content, but the content doesn't rely on the color"**
