# Designing audiobooks for exercisers

(See the example of audiobook app in the lecture video.)

- At the end of the first iteration of the design life cycle, we have three low-fidelity prototypes, each with some feedback on how well they work.
    - We have an increased **understanding of the problem**
    - We also know what **questions to ask next**
- Iteration 2
    - Needfinding: Use the evaluation results from the first iteration to **inform the next iteration**
    - Design alternatives: **expand** on our current ideas and explore new ones
    - Prototyping: may **increase the fidelity** of our prototypes (depending on how feasible it is)
    - Evaluation: **a bit more objective** this time, though qualitative feedback may still be needed
- After two iterations, we have a better understanding of the task and the solution space. We now need another iteration to **get something that we can implement and deploy**.
- Iteration 3
    - Needfinding: what we know from the previous iterations will **inform the this iteration**
    - Design alternatives: e.g. **consider pros and cons/feasibility/usability** of the previous designs, **refine** the design
    - Prototyping: e.g. **merging** the best parts of the previous prototypes (still low-fidelity because we've never had such a prototype before, so we want to make sure it works before we invest in a high-fidelity prototype)
    - Evaluation
- More iterations
    - The cycle continues even after first deployment
    - Needfinding with live users: e.g. data logging, user tracking, user reviews etc.

# Approaches to user-centered design

- **Participatory design**:
    - **users** are involved in the **design team**
    - need to **be careful not to overrepresent** that one user's view
- **Action research**:
    - addresses an **immediate problem** and researches it by trying to **simultaneously solve it**
    - e.g. a teacher trying a new teaching method and observes its effectiveness in the classroom
    - data is gathered on the success of the approaches and is used to inform the understanding of the problem and future approaches
    - Undertaken by the **actual users**
- **Design-based research**:
    - **similar to action research**, but it can be done by **outside practitioners** as well
    - especially common in learning sciences
    - designers design **interventions based on their current understanding** of the theory and the problem, and they **use the success of those interventions to improve** our understanding of the theory or the problem
	    - e.g. if we believe a certain intersection had a lot of jaywalkers because the signs have poor visibility, we might interview people at the intersection for their thoughts, or create a solution that assumes that we're right and evaluate it
- All of these approaches are **iterative**
