# Introduction

- "Politics" here is about **how artifacts create changes** in the world and society. We will dicuss some aspects of this:
    - **Designing** for change
    - **Anticipating** change
    - **Value-Sensitive** Design

- Three goals of HCI:
    - **usability**: help users do the task
    - **research**: understand how a user does a task
    - **change**: change the way a user does a task due to some value (e.g. safety, privacy, etc.)
        - **may be in conflict** with the above two motivations

- Consider how our designs may:
    - invoke changes
    - perpetuate undesirable stereotypes
    - create new dynamics in the society
    - etc.

# Paper spotlight: Do artifacts have politics? 

Winner, L. (1980). Do artifacts have politics? Daedalus, 121-136.

- Many artifacts demonstrate **political characteristics/ motivations**
- Example: the belief that nuclear power can only be used in a totalitarian society because of the inherent danger of the technology; solar power is more compatible with social equity than centralized technologies
    - A nuclear power plant itself does not have political power, but the push for certain technologies can be politically motivated
- Two ways that an artifact can have politics:
    - **Inherently political**: they are **only compatible with certain political structures** (e.g. nuclear power requires considerable top-down organization)
    - Technologies **used to achieve political motives**: when a technology is **used in a particular context for a particular purpose**, it can **accomplish some political goals**

# Change

## Negative change by design

- Example: City planner Robert Moses designed parkways that had low bridges to prevent buses from using them
- Example: Without net neutrality, companies may be able to set up fast lanes that prioritize their own content

## Positive change by design

- Example: Facebook's like reactions
    - More than just a "like" button. Although less convenient, it allows for more nuanced responses, fostering more meaningful interactions
- Example: Facebook's relationship status
    - Allows for more diverse relationships such as "Civil Union" or "Domestic Partnership", supporting social change

## Positive change by happenstance

- Positive change happens as a **byproduct** of technological advancement
	- Example: The invention of bicycles led to shifting in gender roles as women were able to travel more freely

## Negative change by happenstance

- Example: high-speed internet has widened the economic gap between rural and urban areas and perpetuates wealth inequality

# Value-Sensitive Design

- The idea of invisible design **integrates interfaces into the user's life**
- This requires the design to **share the user's values**
- "Value-sensitive design seeks to provide theory and method to **account for human values in a principle and systematic manner throughout the design process**" (VSD Research Lab, University of Washington)
- Example: **privacy by design** preserves the value of privacy

## Paper spotlight: Value Sensitive Design and Information Systems

Friedman, B., Kahn, P. H., & Borning, A. (2008). Value sensitive design and information systems. The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, 69-101.

- Three investigations for approaching value-sensitive design:
    - **Conceptual** investigations: 
        - **thought experiments** to explore the role values play
        - e.g. who are the direct/indirect stakeholders? How are they affected?
    - **Empirical** investigations:
        - explore how **real users** make sense of interfaces
        - e.g. how do stakeholders apprehend individual values in the interactive context? How do they **prioritize values and usability**?
    - **Technical** investigations:
        - Like empirical investigations, but targeting the **system instead of the user**
        - Is the system compatible with the values of the users?

- Fundamental features of value-sensitive design:
    - **proactive**
    - distinguishing between **usability and human values**

## Value-sensitive design across cultures

- Different cultures have different values
- Example: "Right to be forgotten" in the EU vs. the US
    - Values in conflict: privacy vs. freedom of speech

## 5 tips for value-sensitive design

1. **Start early**
    - Identify values early and check on them throughout the design process
2. Know your **users**
    - Understand the values of the users
    - Some values are incompatible (e.g. privacy vs. record-keeping)
3. Consider **both direct and indirect stakeholders**
    - Think about indirect stakeholders who may be affected by the design
4. Brainstorm the **interface's possibilities**
    - Think about how the interface can be **used in ways that were not intended**
5. Choose carefully between **supporting values and prescribing values**

# Reversing the relationship

- Technology changes society, but society also **changes technology**
- Example: motivation to preserve the power or profits of an influential group may hinder the adoption of a new technology
