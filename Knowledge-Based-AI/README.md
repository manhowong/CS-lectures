CS 7637 (Fall 2023)  
Man Ho Wong  

This folder contains my lecture notes for the course CS 7637 taught by Dr. Ashok Goel at Georgia Tech. All images are taken from the lecture slides unless otherwise noted. Most of the lectures align pretty well with the book [Artificial Intelligence by Patrick Winston](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Artificial_Intelligence/b4owngEACAAJ?hl=en).

The syllabus and the readings for Fall 2023 are not publicly available currently, but you can find the syllabus for Spring 2023 [here](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2023/).
