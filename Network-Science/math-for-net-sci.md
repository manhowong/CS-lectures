# Math for Network Science

This document contains a list of math concepts and lingos that are often used in network science. The list should cover the topics found in the Georgia Tech's graduate course, "Network Science: Methods and Applications" (CS 7280). 

Though CS 7280 is not a math course, but the subject itself is an *application of mathematics*. Therefore, besides lots of graph theory, it also involves a bit of calculus, a bit of linear algebra, a bit of statistics, a bit of probability, a bit of set theory... and even a bit of math proofs...

If you are planning to take CS 7280 without a math or quantitative background, be prepared to see some of the math concepts here during the course. You do not need to understand everything, but you should at least know the difinition of the terms.

## The List

> Note: I assume that readers have basic background in undergraduate-level calculus and statistics, so such topics will not be included in the list.

- Eingenvector and eingenvalue
- Divergent/ convergent solution
- n'th moment
- Mutual information
- Monotonic function
- Submodularity
- Proof by contradiction (and other methods of math proof)
- Set membership, subset, union, intersection, cardinality (Set Theory)

(The list is growing...)
