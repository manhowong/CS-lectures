Host: Hello there in TV land, online members. Also participating today is the special day I try each semester. It leaks what's to have professionals who actually apply machine learning and AI in finance come and speak to us. Today we're fortunate to have a team from SunTrust who is here in Atlanta to tell us some of the things they do with finance using these same techniques. Also, be advised that they are looking to hire both full-time employees and interns. So pay attention and take down their email addresses during the presentations. They said that they're willing to answer questions along the way. So if you have questions, please raise your hand and ask. For some press team, repeat the question because the people online aren't necessarily going to have heard it. So repeat it. Also, sometimes that someone's on the back. Let me start off by inviting House Key to come in and give us an overview of what we're going to hear from SunTrust. 

**Speaker 1**

So when you think about the investment process, we will talk a little bit about that today. We help facilitate investors investing in the securities, right? And how we apply machine learning and AI algorithmic tools is a little bit of a different version of what and how traditional investment management companies and hedge funds operate. Thank you. So we talked about, along with me, I have Jeff Hughes who's responsible for equity research. I'll talk briefly about three things that we're doing and thinking about doing. He'll be talking about one of those three things as well. We have Ominous by the Emergency who's responsible for data and analytics and is nervous in the consumer market. And John, well, you know who is responsible for risk and analytics with the bank itself. So my briefing touched on three things that I'll pass off. Feel free to interrupt me with questions along the way. 

Three main bodies of work exist within investment banks at the moment, including SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. First is trade identification. Okay, so if you think about what a dealer is, a dealer is a market maker who is trying to buy and sell securities. Some of them they own, some of them they don't own. Some of these markets are not before. So if you come to me and you ask me to buy specific securities that I do not know, it would be really useful for me as a salesperson or the trader to quickly identify something that has similar characteristics. It fits the needs of the client. Machine learning and analytics will be able to analyze behaviors of individuals and companies themselves. The creative analytics is redeployed to determine whether or not a transaction is a suitable fit. It could, in fact, make a transaction happen between us at the investment bank and that client, as opposed to having another investment bank away across their trade identification. With big and important deals, that's fairly new. If you think about it, it's kind of what Amazon does. 

In trade execution, traditionally, trade execution within investment banks, except those on the trading group, has been identified through right identify factors that could be quickly analyzed to produce a price with or without human intervention. That's been around for a long time. What's changing is the analytical power that's available for cloud computing and computing services that allow for the machines to start to learn how to enhance the algorithms independently of human intervention. So trade, thinking of it more broadly, trade algorithms that start to use machine learning to determine and optimize the business model itself, the other market itself. And then lastly, research. A large part of what investment banks do, and we're no different, is spend a lot of time analyzing companies and markets. 

In order to do that, we need a data science program behind us that supports all three disciplines I just talked about. We are embarking on a science project which will, more broadly speaking, having grown up, I was originally a science major and then changed to finance. I wish I stayed in science because the market is coming your way. A lot of what we're going to be working on, and I believe a lot of the future leaders, not only at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey but broadly speaking investment banks, are going to have your backgrounds. So the more you can focus on programming and understanding finance, the more valuable you are going to be to powertrain above our company and how the striker for talent as well. So I'll answer any questions throughout the day, but I don't want to take Jeff's time. So I'll pass it off to Jeff to talk a bit more about that. 

**Speaker 2**

Good afternoon everyone, it's a pleasure to be sort of Tech's campus. It definitely sets the vibrancy packed room straight to the here at campus. As Bob mentioned, my name is Jeff Hughes. I run equity research at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Quick background before I get into talking about how we and the sell-side are using data and analytics to provide value to the buy-side. I've been in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey for about three, four, five years. I've been director of equity research in that capacity. Before joining SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, I spent 15 years at a global investment bank, spending time in New York as well as Chicago. Before that, I received my MBA at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. Before that, I spent seven years in corporate banking in Chicago and did my undergrad at the University of Notre Dame. As Bob mentioned, I think 20 years from now, maybe in ten years, maybe seven years from now, the background of the directors of equity research will have backgrounds like yours. So this is very relevant. I think the opportunities in this career for folks with your background are significant and substantial. 

Before I get started and talk a little bit about analytics, I want to just give everyone a little background on our history of the securities industry. There are a lot of terms thrown around by the buy-side and sell-side issuers. I just want to make sure that everyone understands some of the basics here. On the sell-side, we're talking about broker-dealers and investment banks. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, for example, other firms you've probably heard of, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan. We're sell-siders and we provide information and trading execution to our clients. On the buy-side, that's institutional investors that are clients of ours. That includes long-only complexes, asset management complexes like American Century, Wellington, Fidelity, names you're probably familiar with. It also includes increasingly catchments, names that you're probably familiar with, Citadel, Surveyor, Bridgewater, for example. Ray Dalio is on TV this morning. Better thought that. Also, pension funds and endowment funds are considered institutional investors on the buy-side. Lastly, issuers are publicly traded companies that we might cover. There are about 3,700 publicly traded companies on the US Stock Exchange. This is spring. 

Moving on, what does a sell-side analyst do? In our research department, we have about 100 teammates and about 40 publishing equity research analysts covering a variety of industries from TMT to financials to consumer to industrial energy. You name it, they cover verticals, etc. They really wear a number of different hats. One is consultants. They serve as an industry expert on typically 10 to 30 companies that are covered. At SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our 40 analysts on average cover about 20 stocks. They serve as a portfolio of consultants to our clients on the buy-side. They provide information to clients to help them make better investment decisions. They also serve as financial analysts. They build multi-year forecasts, establish earnings estimates, sales estimates, and those can be extremely helpful to the buy-side. 

We also do fundamental channel check research, which is extremely important. The job has really changed pretty dramatically from being a reporter who previews and reviews to really doing more value-added work. Now, our research analysts are on the road an awful lot. They spend a lot of time doing primary research, attending conferences, and taking our companies to see institutional investors as well. So the job is changing. I referenced that earlier. The job of a research analyst used to be focused on publishing earnings previews and recaps, and that's really become commoditized. The real value-added now is coming out of quantitative, differentiated, proprietary work that the buy-side will pay for. Increasingly, the buy-side won't pay for recaps. It has very little value. You can see on this graph here that the amount of money that our clients are spending on data has been growing astronomically. \$168 million on data just two years ago, \$400 million this year, and the outlook for data spending going forward is very robust. 

When we talk about alternative data, I want to make sure everyone's kind of clear on this. How is the buy-side using it? Generally, alternative data is independent data. It does not come directly from the companies that we cover. It's basically information that helps the buy-side understand insights on the income statement, specifically revenues as well as margins, and coming up with earnings per share estimates. There are all kinds of alternative data, as I've spelled out here. Some of the data is stuff you're probably familiar with: credit card data, satellite imaging, social media data, online product reviews, and search patterns on popular word searches.

And you'll see in the bottom pie graph there, alternate ideas. This software data is considered more accurate than others, specifically credit card data. It has great valued information, as does web scraping data. So how are housed data analytics used in the research process? Really two ways. Number one is data management, and the second item is mass analytics. Data management: you have to obtain the data first. If drafted, it comes from labor-intensive web scraping, or you can buy the data from third-party data providers. The second thing is data cleansing, which is very, very important. This is probably the most difficult and most value-added element here on this page. Most of the reason for that is most of the data, many experts say, is really not usable. Why is that? You might have time series that are wrong, you might have different years of data, and you have questions about whether you can normalize the data or test the data. You use some statistical tools to assess if the data is good or bad. That's very, very important in the buy-side of the stuff. So they spend a lot of time trying to clean the data. 

Once you clean the data, the next part is making the data presentable. Then a number of tools and advanced analytics are used to test and run hypotheses. You've got scenario analysis and simulation, correlation analysis, and machine learning for pattern recognition and regression analysis. Now, the next slide here shows the big picture of how we use the analytics. We use it to improve the quality of our research, to focus more on higher value-added work such as deep dive thematic pieces and differentiated real research. We're moving away from what I described earlier as the commoditized research product, which is just reporting and is not valued by our clients on the buy-side. We also use it as a tool to help us be more efficient, allowing us to cover more stocks, and lastly, to become more client-centric. 

As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot more money than Athena by the buy-side. Essentially, every type of client, whether you're a small-cap manager, a large-cap manager, a long-only asset manager with a three-year or less time horizon, or a hedge fund with a two-week time horizon, wants more data. Here are some examples on the next few slides. I've got some examples of analytics in specific verticals we'll talk about. I'm not going to go through every single one of these, but you can take a look at these online and see some of the applications of how they're used. In the consumer space, we have an analyst right now who covers cruise lines. He scrapes cruise line data from websites, either travel agency websites or directly from the cruise lines, and he finds changes in pricing to be very effective in understanding the trends and top-line. That's been very well received by the buy-side. 

There are also analysts on the street who check inventory on some websites like AutoNation or Carvana. They'll check them on a weekly basis and look at the SKUs, the vehicle identification numbers, to identify how product is moving, how quickly it is discounted, etc. That can be very helpful in identifying current trends. Also, on social media sites, we use their focus. It gives a lot of tools to quantify reviews of social media sites, and that can be very valuable as well. Other verticals in healthcare look at trends in advertising and the correlation between drug spending to come up with sales projections. Also, currently approved drugs and non-approved drugs, looking at comparative profiles, product descriptions, and the related companies to try to formulate what the top line might look like and if it mirrors competitive products, coming up with its kind of peak revenue and sustainable revenues going forward. Also, within the DMT vertical, there are a lot of technology tools being used. 

I mentioned earlier scraping pricing data. Let's see a couple of examples. They're cited Google Trends search word analysis, a lot of reviews on websites, etc. Then, more than gas is another energy sector. There's a lot of analytics used to scrape data and come up with unique insights. So how are we currently using data and analytics? How will it be used in the future? We have a regional real estate investment trusts analyst, and Kim Kibum puts out a quarterly piece by the key to self-scores. He covers a number of publicly traded self-storage companies, REIT companies, and he goes through three hundred self-storage units to come up with pricing trends and promotions. This has been very predictive in understanding near-term trends, and it's basically must-reading for anyone in the investment self-storage space right now. Kim Kibum is working with our restaurant analyst, Jake Bartlett, who manually reduces pricing items on a number of websites in the fast-casual restaurant space, such as like an Ardent's or Dave and Buster's, coming up with unique insights on pricing. That's been very valuable. Our leisure analyst covers theme parks and golf manufacturing equipment, as well as boat manufacturers. Mike Schwartz does proprietary work understanding how new products, especially, are tracking monthly. We use a lot of data analytics to identify trends in pricing and the top line. In the future, we want to use some tools to help us in a couple of other verticals, specifically energy and aerospace. 

There are a number of government websites that you can access and use some tools to help us accumulate data. For example, on a county basis, how the wells are performing, the productivity of certain wells in certain counties in the state of Texas. The same thing with aerospace and defense, about data points from government websites. There's a current example that's pretty neat. 

About three or four months ago, our internet analyst, Yusef Scolay, came out with a report really focusing on Amazon and specifically their private label business. Clothing specifically. We looked at SKUs offered by Amazon's most competitive brands, like Calvin Klein and other competitors, and others in pricing data on each brand. What Yusef concluded is that Amazon's private label brands have a tremendous opportunity to continue to gain share based on customer reviews and the Amazon private label brand versus other competitor brands. This is going to be a source of upside, we think, for Amazon in the near term and longer term. There's been a great call. We got a lot of publicity on this one. It was highlighted in the New York Times Sunday edition on G24, and Amazon's stock is up about 15% since we published this data. It's one of our most widely read pieces of research over the last year. 

So in conclusion, the times are really changing in equity research on the buy-side as well as the sell-side. The days of sell-side research analysts relying on poorly previewed summaries to do primary research are over. The buy-side just won't pay for that anymore. The buy-side is demanding more proprietary, creative, and quantitative research from the sell-side. Technology advancements are creating a tremendous opportunity for us to add value to the top of the key proprietary insights to offer the buy-side. The Holy Grail is taking the expertise and experience of our analysts and combining it with the technology tools that are in place right now and continuing to evolve. The power of the data, combined with the intellectual insights of our analysts, is really where the Holy Grail is with regard to the buy-side using sell-side research going forward. 

With that, I'm happy to take any questions. It's more scientific. It's more like from the heart. So the question is, when we come up with, when you're looking at companies, how do we assess what data sources will be valuable? Is that kind of the gist of the question? So that's a very good question, and it really comes down to our analysts. They all have quite a bit of experience in their industry, understanding what key drivers are with regard to the top line. I mentioned the impact on the business model, and a lot of it is just having an understanding of being an industry expert and understanding what will drive those key variables. Give me an example. There are some third-party data providers who will give you parking lot data. So if you've had a consistent panelist who covers Home Depot or Lowe's, for example, there are entities out there that will provide parking lot data, satellite feeds to give you an understanding of how busy the parking lot is, specifically on weekends, because that's when the majority of sales occur for these two companies.

If you can have a greater understanding of the weather impact, for example, there's been particularly visible weather in the spring that can have an adverse impact on traffic for Home Depot, specifically the garden area. Home Depot and that can really drive your tournament Psalter Home Depot or Lowe's. That's one example. It's really having an understanding of what's driving underlying metrics that are most important. When you see the store sales comps at a retail environment, it might be foot traffic. It really depends on the specific industry and specific company.

What I might say is on top of that, so I think the answer is it can be both. We're starting at about on the thesis that it can be both. We want the expertise that the fundamental analysts tell us. I think you're interesting, and then we try to find better ways to access data or more unique datasets that maybe do a couple of layers below that. But then there's also the discipline of finding unique datasets and patterns, things that we didn't think were correlated to a particular stock. That's the initiative that we're starting to kick off in 2019. So I think you can approach it from a data scientist perspective, and that can inform an equity fundamental research analyst. Then you can take equity funding our research, and you can find better patterns and datasets around the things they care about.

A lot of firms are setting up subsidiaries around the thesis that you can create unique data sets into the revenue graph that Jeff showed. I think that's probably a fair assessment of the capacity to both empower the 40 analysts that we have but also create a new discipline and a new product that can be sold into the buy side as well.

Imagine a fresh Georgia Tech graduate completes this course and starts work at SunTrust. Where would you mention they would plug in here? For instance, would they be paired with an analyst? Would they be an analyst? The answer to that question is there's plenty of opportunities in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Yes, you could come in and work with one of our unity experts. Bob referenced new investment that software office members are making in analytics and data science. We are building a data science team. We're in the process of trying to hire a data scientist right now, and then we'll be building a team around that person. There would be great opportunities there to come in and work with our data scientists. I'll give you props right now actually for that position because there are plenty of opportunities. I truly do believe that 10 years from now, after all these years, the next PMR will have quantitative experience.

Data makes very tall using to store your data or using something centralized. Second, specific tools you're using create analytics. At this point, would you like to plug in visualization packages? Third, how big is this enough trust puppets at Humphrey to measure how big it is? Okay, sure. So the question is what data sets are we using right now? Heavies are new data has to be databases. What kind of local tools are we using right now? And then the size of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Let me start with the last one, which is the easiest for someone who doesn't have a flat background. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is about two billion in revenues roughly. 

**Speaker 1**

The investment bank subsidiary of SunTrust Bank is about eleven hundred and sixty people. Sales drink is about three hundred sixty of that. Equity researchers got hard about the data analytics team. I have about seven people at the moment. Let's continue. It's a fairly new initiative for us. There are a few databases, one essentially owned. The nice thing about being associated with Bank speak is that there's a lot of infrastructure that's available in the shared preferences. There's that awake that's available for big data and analytics around the data link. We have to call it at us. The recent initiative that was stood up within SunTrust Bank itself. 

That's why I said, you know, I get no for free in life, but I have the ability to access tools. Primarily every research analyst and journalist people. QCF folks that we have most of our folks on Python are and an Alexa colony. But we're in very early stages, as Jeff mentioned, building out a data science team. I think that's to me an excitement right there. A lot of opportunity is available when you're starting something new around the investment bank. I grew up in an investment bank that was very small and became very big. We came to be event. So roughly about my career, it's aligning ourselves with the right firm given the interest rates that we're using. You can take Duke Ramon steps. 

Just building off of Jeff's comment that I do want to turn our team's, you know, what is the fun of a research animal tab? They have c-suite relationships, which you don't have, and they have industry expertise, which you don't. What's their biggest fear? That in analytics, because they know that that's important to how they're going to remain relevant. Why? Because the c-suite at the firms that we research are spending a lot of money on data analytics themselves. So if you can't converse in a meaningful way and collaborate, you're going to start to become less and less relevant to the c-suite of research companies that we focus on. So they need help. That's my job, trying to find the resources available. That's why we're talking to you guys. Does that make sense? The introduction is very good. So certain over Nevada, then that's okay. So we can get another claim in the power user. 

**Speaker 3**

It was on them and they need, we need an analyst office. I'm here to tell you, well, I get this job. We need a couple of months back. I was waiting for myself. Should they talk to you about the ABS radical machine learning? Should they talk to you about OD beginning this week at work for them to evacuate? Can't quite be event. Oh, that easily Leslie itself can use machine learning. This is something I've been discussing with my leadership. So I thought I will start it there and even more of an industry perspective rather than specific areas. Valuable solution land. There was a question about how big is geologists. I started helping the consumer bankers. We are about six beginning revenues. We have a seventy-five, seventy-six billion portfolio in loans. The assets under management is about 65 million, which these are big numbers. Depositor billion that you are able and to admire by itself to be a fortunate man. It's a huge part of the package, not just because the furniture with the deposits or any of you back with interest are the big leaves them that we ran other parts of the back wholesale and things from back to okay. Deposits are lifeblood for the backyard. So if this is a statistic from what's returned along a very shiny things for you, this is the Bostrom. How many of you are back with the top three banks in the United States? JP Morgan is part of America right here. I have given an incremental deposit of 118 billion include 2017. Last year alone, we are fake.

JP Morgan and Wells Fargo got an increment to the classics of a hundred and eighteen billion, just like right off the bat. Anybody defending by regional banks that inputs undress me dat PNC cap one MND 22 refill packs together. Guess how much deposit cigar definition together people making it looks like negative 55 year. So, 55 billion had an 18 billion this busy way is the getting larger and larger party. There is something to scale right big in the back because they take lots of growth. Seems like that right? So, I know it takes how many of you think Google, Amazon, Facebook, these can accompany somebody rule the world. I feel I disagree with that notion, by the way. Up to do what you no matter traditional marketing Marvel is being redefined. Have told you about how the traditional analysts experiment data scientist. They could be better together, be improved, proven the humanity myself. Man argument human plus machine together is better than human or machine. Yeah, this hybrid glad today traditional Viking has been refined. How many of you have you missed a toast? How many of you have made more than 100 trades in the past one year? JP Morgan all the investment accounts free if you're making less than hundred trades. 99 percent of the class will do free trade to date the market. If you have me on snack on that, I went back and checked how many trades in Maine last year. 37 I'll be ok with it the market. How doesn't have a baby? A lot of different business models are coming, so you have to me the way you want to play something right. Either you play with your money, which you do for other banks, but if you use JPMorgan you feed it the data. A lot of subscription models are out there. JP Morgan wants to take like a Netflix-like subscription model. They want you all here is another another thing that is also a problem with the traditional man. This is JP Morgan's offering something about you have to be 75,000 in better investment account total is related to access their private profit. They have lowered the bar. This is going to change the industry in Sandra's for all these services. You need a minimum of \$100,000 in English classes or in some cases trillion-dollar of English classes. The lower the water and things still it is still flawed. If I am not having 75,000 and lift them but I'm really a high net worth god. Okay, so most of the mystery is going with rules not with an adaptive machine learning type approach to make implement the strategies. This is a challenge that I forced my leadership. Why don't you learn from other industries right? Some of you think Google or Amazon when disagree hearest why. If you look at for my history right look at the list of all these companies these are huge numbers. Johnson & Johnson those twice in the largest theaters all of them have more than hundred years of history. They have weathered so much they have been litigated creative Christian world wars they're still dominating the market right. This started all this company started with organic industry aspirin. Well like that then they migrated to microbiology vaccines and so I mean I get that it's not right and then now they are like in genomics. They have a core of research development right that's it for their favorite from one market mr. Fleming to another discipline other than knowledge discipline from a technology suite from organic chemistry to microbiology to genomics. When it comes to bags and you use the same template I think it is guests come to my back especially is the knowledge about the planet. If we go to village somewhere they'll acknowledge who is coming in the Baker comes in the killer knows the family they have keep going to school and all that it's like a book life's knowledge right and how it will the point is that a baby use that treat the kind of friendly peter differentiated client experience regardless of how much you want. It's not like you have a scientific person are freaking in one way a hundred thousand million other three let's go through that's not going to work. So if we if you use that kind of the same template for centuries times really thrive on it remediation somebody wanted money. Somebody has accepted money banks when between loans called capital markets it's into mediation work very well for centuries. Somebody in Colombia and out of the capital market type fee the reins of the 2% percent range for centuries 600 BC accompany outwards very well then access to make you a big part. Do you know who serviced the greatest invention the banking has done in the past 50 or 60 years is a p.m. in the channel fader pin Spandana cleans felt very silly. Although you said that which is true the access to the money 24 bits of an access to money red black from into mediation access today it is fine secrecy anybody who can do well in fact centricity and do really well. So what is classic recipe actually mean 90% of average live 20 miles from the nearest Walmart 90 percent right. When I go to Walmart your shaving cream like socks a t-shirt or anything like that right while one treats me as a way to push inventory of TM inventory sales banks are very similar but still your money market account deposit account credit cards tea lights mortgages in you go sort right. If a good amazon.com it's all planned century my landing page is very different from yours. It caught my eccentric to the knowledge discipline that could be as into clients intricity is machine learning and language it is another example of how this is analytics can differentiate us. You are the investment course and then here this is the question. These companies there are two different companies in here blue and red right both have a very similar market cap like one has and then 1564 what company sometimes they are the same industry it's not for with big loss. I mean I like your thinking when you're going it's similar and you guys look at the invoice number two parts look at the P there is something we all support for sale sports and something else. Let's fix what is not good so why would Netflix have this PE best swabiz means this much I think white suit what is it flip flicks to be 148 vs. yeah so we haven't gotten to Kiki yet in the course but it's a market based 150 times more far from the earnings it's Christmas so they're in \$1 a year there's 42 dollars and by the way that's an outrageously large number. How do you really substantiate something even if you give this recommendation you come up with some numbers okay. Algorithms go and give this to therefore I Bob let me ask you what would you that's it feeling makes sense to me it makes sense 21 days. Disney Disney owns Lucas was listening on Fixer Disney on I will they have all these assets massive assets how many of us depends how many have Netflix a Disney has all these assets but when I go see a movie in a neighborhood they are together right. I'm gonna answer customer how did this nation if it buying is 10 years old so what don't worry he calls himself an adult so I find something which is good sensor I find I find something I get it I'm I'm a target client or a Walmart when I will invite the toy this thing has lost the sight of the time they accumulated the assets they don't have my identity. We cannot use machine learning and analytics like Netflix this necklace has all right balls. They don't want to watch what you don't watch oh thank you can we how much we pause how much we feet are wet right. What does it use of all that Netflix was a DVD many government not long before when you play kids then the debate when display the period themselves are made for streaming and now they have interest of Hollywood production later from zero ten years back the papers almost 10% of the Hollywood racks that comes with principle they can produce something without their the confidence that power cannot you know how I would have how do economics is like Tom you must obey you put something out there pay for a full Eclipse many companies which products like the Hollywood economics the comments ok the business plan I'm sorry which which is not networks they listen happy the client centricity is a team for some question. Relax and the water we do we do - spine is going to be very different from my back and the bank of the future he's going to use nowadays he's going to use machine like much more you know in an effective way that could keep clients interested and a walking are taking another advancement that the bank will know me much better. Just like the village ever 20 years of experience no it's the community practice knowledge will be hot and the motivating factor is to our exhibition one right before I stop I want to show something else a couple of minutes video. How many of you have heard company called NATO robot right so the reason of their play this is you're going to learn a lot or machine learning and hope the donation money or your family love it because our division occlusions is going to automate many or post right. This is this is a company I visited like a year back fascinated different good some experience at them latest in that NATO robot is an automated machine learning platform that helps you solve business problems by finding the best predictive model for your data. An incredibly clean interface allows analysts developers and data professionals to rapidly build highly accurate predictive models embedding the best practices of the world's top data scientists into every model they built. Massively parallel processing allows users to build many models at once so the work that used to take weeks now happens in an afternoon. Instead of guessing which model will work for any given data set neither robot system. We compared models built with Python scikit-learn our spark h2o valve a lab ik tensorflow and others models are described with incredible transparency.


And data robot uses novel techniques to extract deep insights from each and every one. Known as you can use those for your homework one line API code at the touch of a button.

With Dana robot, you can deliver predictive analytics and insights to your business in hours instead of months. Data robot, the world's most advanced machine learning platforms for accurate predictive modeling, made easy, fast, and powerful.

So there's the same method all day getting it in this trendy love with some glitter. Jeff talks about the data sets, aggregating all those data sets and making sense. Link created, I could influence the oven logic. It will be worth much more than working underneath.

So there is a story from you. You must report this. The monk is classy, and he sees reports stock instruments literally. So it's asking one of them, "Hit, what have you believed?" He says, "Oh, can't you see?" And dispatch installs fastest 10 meters, 20 meters. That is our guiding padding in the stands. And he's asking the same question, "Hey, what are you doing?" The other cases, "Oh yeah, building this beautiful cathedral. This is going to be the biggest church in the village."

And he gives life information. Machine learning analytics is like stacking stones, right? What you do with it is much more important. Man government, so if you are looking for a very, you are all very bright, I think.

The thing that could differentiate you in the marketplace and give you a lot of fulfillment in your career is Spain. Build the cathedral. And I'm finding with JP Morgan because it has presence in ribbon. Even though I'm in Atlanta right now, I go tomorrow and go to different states. And I want my bank within it in that state. And the note1 happen at the bank.

And so how do you think I'll trust will be able to complete with that in future? So tomorrow they will do mobile banking because I've done the presence of the bank. Whether there is a branch or ATM in there won't would it matter? Or do you think of expanding branches in various locations will be more than the question is? I want to buy with a bank which has presence in all states, not to the regional branch which is localized. What do you think tomorrow is gonna be?

So tomorrow the definition of bank is changed. You think probably of branches and sinus. You probably think of a mobile app. Tomorrow there are a lot of how many of you for a few years the amount identity six one zero any of the internet-only banks. It's catching up real real quick. So the notion of what man is will change. And you will be able to identify with an entity that would manage your finances in a very different way but just with technology rather than the physical structure.

Mr. Wall, any other questions? Yes, resilience. No wonder if you see here if that's because that product with the creating is more essential where it's perceived to be. I'm seen banking in a proceed similarly essential thing or does that allow something that's building that how fast you catch up with technology choices.

So then the question is we talk about banking and farm on financial services. Farm is very essential. Financial services can equate earth. What is the relationship, right? Is it the same? How many of you want to have a life that is that's our poverty? So how many of you don't want to suffer from already? How many of you want to buy a car? How many of you want to buy your business, right?

So when you think of bank, you don't think the quality's essentially financial services enables this and much more. It's fundamental to a society that wants to make progress. Whether the back of today can do this well, it's a test for tomorrow. Matter the future is going to be much much better than and we want to be the back of the future by the way just like boxing.

**Speaker 4**

My name's John. Normally no ie represents good finance data analytics office. So I unfortunately don't have a slider interesting presentation. But what my area does is it manages data foundation, the analytics capabilities that some trucks uses to manage its risk. And that has a fairly wide distribution of these days. So one microcosm of my space is I take your time.

So within the financial private space, we are monitoring for money laundering, human trafficking, tariffs financing, and then fraud identity theft. Each one of those traditionally has presented different challenges. Prevents some extent you'll way of managing these things were to create routes for behaviors. So look for new accounts. Look for counts that world be now. That's a look for accounts with multiple cash deposits of fur accounts that have frequently that frequently changes address.

The problem with any of any of those methods is those traps pretty quickly become obsolete. Criminals in the game who are intending to do on to us are pretty quick adapting and finding those traps. And then they may operate in a way that's the other side of the capability of the rules to find machine learning is truly an area where banks are just starting to move into the fourth line of the nation according to create opportunities to bringing lots of data together in a way that can be that can be utilized to manage active threats and an ever-changing method committing fraud laundering money for finding terrorism.

Within our space, we have opportunities to develop machine learning models that can deal with almost every aspect of it. So one of the one of them I'm going to go very micro beat at a very high level. A very common problem that mayonnaise is third party check fraud. So what that means is you as a SunTrust client or presenting with attack from outside us or us. So non us on trust jackets Bank of America. We make it China can be any way they read each other's it presents it to us. We have to her law make an assessment very quickly but then 24 hours really determine whether your tech needs to be helped or whether we need to make those funds available to you.

To do that, we need to bring together a vast amount of information. We need to understand who you are. What is your routine types of activities? Is this outside of the norm for you? Are you likely to be committing fraud that's up but above that I know you like you trust in you. Do I know the other guy? Do I know the guy who wrote you a check? Do I know the institution a check was really fun that requires us to bring in to play information that could be provided by a third party. It could be other information that we have across the organization. It could be a list watch list that we've accumulated watch this that we purchase and we bring all that information to bear like to determine whether or not there was a probability fraud on that check.

I presented a whole new host or problem that banks something typically had to deal with in the past. They need to deal with it as we would dispose of contacts. So I was presented by a third-party check. The traditional way to handle that was we just wouldn't cash the check until the other bank made good on the text deposited their funds into our accounts. We thought that it was pre safe but now make those funds available. But the world is changing one the clients are unstable for it the two of the regulator regulators.

So in this case, we're bringing together datasets from a vast amount of sources. So in some cases structured data where we're looking at things like your account balances of what your addresses unstructured data where we're pulling information out of your social media in order to ensure that you're managing the list. The key to this when you think about it is really the application. So while it's very specific to one new space for SunTrust, the techniques and the capabilities the techniques of capabilities that it provides to us is actually uvula. It could be utilized by many different uses.

So we not talk to you about clients interested in you know there's an extremely valuable propositions of SunTrust to make sure that we're offering you best products and services.

And he will go about doing that for his purposes. But the same techniques that he's going to mean to do that, the know who these clients are, what the probabilities of his clients are to take an offer, what his client is me is going to be the same types of activities and techniques. So we need to do with a larger frog or demonic arrest. You had an earlier question as to whether or not a branch physical location matters, right? So JP Morgan, JP Morgan is located in what places? Thank you, America. Simile, does that matter? And reality is the physical application of the lesson on support. We're moving to a point where the client expects its financial institutions to be available to it when it needs it. Not that isn't tomorrow morning between the hours of 9:00 p.m. That's whenever the client needs it. So you see, you see the advent of things like demo PayPal capabilities to move money and read around very quickly. You've seen the advent of more mobile applications for training so that clients been traded. I've worked with SunTrust for 13 years, and every day when I walk into the office, I pass a branch. SunTrust branches within our physical building. I've been in that branch probably incontinent 13 years, and most of the time can it change? Oh, most banks, most people don't need their publications today. And so the relevancy of our institution is our ability to make some trucks available to go to client when you need it. Now that has application bone impressive space because what that means is I can't risk review your loan application as you present it. By the time you're ready to apply for them, you probably already decided meet the loan. What money now and you're probably in a place where you want to make the purchase. If you think about the way you handle a car purchases, for example, you walk into a loan, you don't have probably, but you want me to a branch or put your check each other. Are yep, how much you pain coming month payments being them you could will finance. I'll be the future banking will be you have been risk rated as a client every single day. And every time you do something through the bank or really anything that would be captured a romana to update your risk profile. And then we make available to you the services and offerings based on the risk profiling presented to us. That's the future event. That's where banking will be in the future. And so we will continue to be relevant if we are able to about the mains that are able to adapt it can can make the financial institutions available to you at the time you need to transact. Those are going to be the banks of the survive. So entrusted made a tremendous amount of investment over the past five years on data infrastructure, large data capabilities and advanced tools like data robot. The challenge will always be the information, the information feeding those machines, the tools and techniques that are used to analyze and to make decisions. But the applications are limitless. So while we're talking about some very specific use cases, they're not limited at all to those use cases we talked about. To give you some idea, the regression models, this the richer models that were used to do Moneyball. All of you guys saw Moneyball first use of statistics and based call to manage baseball teams. Those are the same regression models we use for forecasting balance sheet activity, probability of default analytics that are used to determine portfolio optimization or the machine learning that's used or the neural networks that are used to do machine learning are the same models that we use for optimizing balance sheet size as parameters. The techniques are what is important. The types of information you need to solve a problem now it's important. The particular use case is less relevant because I promise you the problems you will work on the first year you get out of this program will be completely irrelevant to you twenty years into your career. The challenges you will face, the problems you will have to address, the tools that people use, the languages they want exist probably one existed five years after you graduate, but they probably won't exist 20 years junkie graduate. But the foundational capabilities, that's the thought process around what types of information do I need? What types of analytics do I need to apply? That is foundational to success in your careers. So while we talk about the risk finance base and capabilities that we provide for Bangkok or within the consumer bank or within in Robertson hunker in the client base are investment bank. Those are all unique capabilities being applied to a specific problem. I would say that once you can articulate the problem, the techniques that need to be applied to solve those problems are foundational. With that, I'll open it up to questions. 

**Questions**

I know some of you. So what if we get the whole Sun thing? I'm not there yet. I've got a couple questions I can ask from online. Yes, for real. You asked a great question. The way you think about companies and they're really to thrive and survive is oftentimes they have to come up with the right use case, right? If you're a transportation company and you happen to make horse and buggies, you were smart enough to engage in combustion engine emergent technologies become transportation when they make cars. I don't think it's the existential nature of the product that creates a success. I think it's how you think about yourself as a company. And in this instance, SunTrust defines itself as a Purpose Driven confidence in our job distribution financial strikes. And if we think about that and the products we bring to market are going to be substantially good because we're going to be there. That's the point of impact. We're going to not only make it easy to transact, we don't let you know which I actually mean it's actually a good one on the other side, right? So I think we're broadly speaking that just that's how you gently differentiate the successful companies who've been here for a long time versus those that died, right? Nice thing you show top tens at this end. They survived out for the 300. I just wanted to pull a couple questions from online so the so everybody is participating here. Um, one question is so in this class we I kind of take the easy way out and I say volatility is the risk. But what what are other ways? What are other sorts of risks or how do you evaluate risks and your the risk guy? So what's your answer? Well, so first of all, I would say volatilities opportunity, but that's because the opposite end of its was beside the point. Risk is opportunity. Managing risks creates opportunity. The team, the the company that can thank you when no one else will Bank you if you if there's an opportunity to be made. Those are the banks that will be profitable. So it's about using advanced analytics and information to manage manage the res not eliminated right eliminators. But there's lots of time to manage all kinds of if we had the biggest it is usually the folks who begin the carrier in their science make is data is that is because nobody has to cook it there come you collect a lot of data of it that is this thing like the company's measure what we want we see and then they call set all of those if I was data scientist in 2008 little kids back then. I think and you come to me and ask what can the cameras and in yourself so I I do a lot of algorithmic models and say okay you need to sell like high-definition cameras 2008 these men iPhone came up right you need new high-definition cameras put a lot of money in this geography and all that across the street from Sony there was another company zero market cap like a starter they were making crappy cameras where you could put it on even though that everyone like their Kappa Gamma you can put it on your social network what companies are no more up there are machine learning and turned Sony to a pop-rock right so we also we have to think about strategy as an overarching thing. The human mind can bring in a lot more things and make decisions. There, guys, is an aid to office. So if you remove the workers, I think there is is going with one or the other. We get together. That's cannot. In fact, if I catch them, the biggest challenge we face in new careers is access. It's not the analytics techniques, not the software, not that. It's what I mean. Do you have access to the information you need to build the model? And can you get it in it? And when you built the model, can you get that information in a timely enough way to make a difference? It's all fine and good if I know I have a perfect vision of you every month, once a month. But if you want to make a loan three days after I've got that perfect vision of you, it's useless. I need to know everything about you when you want to do something, and that's going to change. So I'm going on the trader in the room. So when you tell me there's more volatility, I'll tell you this: all the things is a difference in the people. So what is your core thesis? What are the analytics and data that you're using to know that core thesis is proving to be right or wrong? And how do you cut your losses? Increased auto setting creates that opportunity, but it also makes you really think long and hard about the parameters that you're willing to take the risk in and how to get out of a position. The number one problem with the trader that I will have for the last 25 years is traders who start to deviate their thesis from their position. Why they own something starts to change. That should happen. You should reset. And in a land of highball, if you just put a trade on and it moves against you immediately, use it. A lot of work to come up with the trade line. The guy who let you throw in the garbage. I think we need to close now. However, I believe they're available still for a few more minutes. So let's thank them, and then if you have more questions, please come up here.
